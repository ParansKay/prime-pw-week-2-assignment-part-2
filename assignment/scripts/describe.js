// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
//  We make a variable called name and we set it's value to "Dane".
// Then we create a conditional statement so that if the value of name is equal to "Mary", then the console.log displays 'Hi, Mary!'
// If the value of the name is not equal to "Mary", then the console.log displays 'How do you do?'

//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// We create a variable called secret and don't assign it a value. 
// Next, we create a variable called code and we assign it the value of number 123
// Next, we create a conditional statement. If the value of code equals 123, then we assign 'super' as the value of secret.  
// And, the value of code now doubles.

// Next, we create another conditional statement. If the value of code is greater than 250, then the value of secret is now set as 'duper'.
// Finally, we console.log the value of secret.

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// First, we create a variable called isStudent and set it's boolean value as true
// Next, we create a variable called age and set it's value to the number 34
// Next, we create a variable called zip and set it's value to the number 55407
// Then, we create a conditional statement. If the value of isStudent is true and the value of zip is greater than 80000, then the console.log will display 'You're a student on the West Coast!'
// If the value of isStudent is false or the value of age is less than 30, then the console.log will display 'What are your hobbies?'
// If the value of isStudent is true, then the console.log will display 'Welcome to Prime!'
// Otherwise, the console.log will display 'How about the weather?'

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment. 
// Should be number++.
number--; 

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
// FIX - The instructions state that variable colorOne is set to blue, therefore the correct syntex should be let colorOne = 'blue'
//let colorOne = 'red';
// FIX - The instructions state that variable colorTwo is set to red, therefore the correct syntex would be let colorTwo = 'red'
//let colorTwo = 'blue';
//let mix = true;

//if (mix === true) {
//colorOne = 'purple';
// FIX The directions state that colorOne AND colorTwo are set to purple. The code only set colorOne to purple.

// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*

// FIX - The description asks for two conditionals to be considered : temp is higher than 39 AND if time is greater or equal to 4. The synthext below indicates an "OR statement". Instead, it should be written as --> if (temp > 39 && time >= 4) {
